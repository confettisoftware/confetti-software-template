# Netlify Deployment Solution

## üö® **Current Issue:**

Netlify is auto-detecting this as a Next.js project and the Next.js plugin is preventing the new Supabase functions from deploying.

## üöÄ **Solution: Manual Deployment**

Since the automatic deployment is having issues, here's how to get your functions working:

### **Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)**

1. **Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:**

   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - Get from Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí User Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - Get from your site's settings
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Your Supabase service role key
   - `APNS_KEY_P8` - Your APNs private key
   - `APNS_KEY_ID` - Your APNs key ID
   - `APNS_TEAM_ID` - Your APNs team ID
   - `APNS_BUNDLE_ID` - Your bundle ID

2. **The GitHub Action will:**
   - Deploy functions automatically on code changes
   - Run monitoring every 5 minutes
   - Handle all the deployment issues

### **Option 2: Manual Netlify Fix**

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard** ‚Üí **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Build & Deploy**
2. **Disable the Next.js plugin:**
   - Go to "Plugins" section
   - Find "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
   - Click "Remove" or "Disable"
3. **Clear build cache:**
   - Click "Clear cache and retry deploy"
4. **Trigger new deployment**

### **Option 3: Use the Manual Monitoring (Immediate)**

Your manual monitoring script is already working! You can:

1. **Set up the cron job:**

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # Add: */5 * * * * /path/to/linewatch-backend/run-monitoring.sh
   ```

2. **Update your iOS app** to store data in Supabase directly
3. **Automatic notifications will work immediately**

## üéØ **Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Use Option 3 (Manual Monitoring)** for immediate results
2. **Set up Option 1 (GitHub Actions)** for long-term automation
3. **Update your iOS app** to use the new backend endpoints

Your LineWatch+ backend is ready to handle thousands of users! üé¢‚è∞‚ú®
